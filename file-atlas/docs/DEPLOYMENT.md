# File Atlas Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- Git for version control

## Development Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-atlas.git
   cd file-atlas
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Building the Application

File Atlas can be built for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

### Platform-Specific Builds

- For Windows:
  ```bash
  npm run build:win
  ```

- For macOS:
  ```bash
  npm run build:mac
  ```

- For Linux:
  ```bash
  npm run build:linux
  ```

- For all platforms:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

Built applications will be available in the `dist` directory.

## Continuous Integration/Deployment

File Atlas uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The pipeline automatically:

1. Runs tests on every push and pull request to main and develop branches
2. Builds the application for all supported platforms
3. Uploads build artifacts for each platform

### CI/CD Pipeline Structure

- **Testing Stage**:
  - Runs on Ubuntu latest
  - Executes the test suite using Jest
  - Must pass before proceeding to build

- **Build Stage**:
  - Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Creates platform-specific builds
  - Uploads artifacts to GitHub

## Performance Optimization

File Atlas implements several performance optimization strategies:

1. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Components are loaded on-demand
   - Reduces initial load time

2. **Virtualization**:
   - Implemented for large file lists
   - Optimizes memory usage and rendering performance

3. **Module Architecture**:
   - Supports easy integration of new visualization modules
   - Enables independent scaling of components

## Troubleshooting

1. **Build Failures**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Remove node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

2. **Runtime Issues**:
   - Check the application logs in the user data directory
   - Verify system requirements are met
   - Ensure proper file permissions

## Security Considerations

1. Keep dependencies updated: `npm audit fix`
2. Follow security best practices in the security documentation
3. Use appropriate file permissions when deploying

## Support

For additional support:
- Create an issue on GitHub
- Check existing documentation in the `docs` directory
- Review the CONTRIBUTING.md file for development guidelines
